React JS

   React js is a javascript library used for builiding user interfaces(single page applications)
  
   https://reactjs.org/
   
   what are the advantages of React JS?

   -> Easy to write code and light weight 
   -> Reusable Component based
      Ex: Ecommerce application : end user , Agents, Students 
          Login Component 
          generic componnet login can be re-used for all type of users -- reusable 
   -> Design simple views for your application 
   -> Not too hard to learn 
   -> React makes it painless to creat interactive UI's 
   
    AJAX -> Asynchronous Javascript(callbacks) and XML
	
	AJAX is not a programming language its a programming concept 
	
	-> using callbacks,promises , async/await we can achieve asynchronous way of programming
	-> Application Programming Interface 
	
	-> Reads data from a web server after the page has been loaded
	-> Updates the page(part of element) without reloading the page
	-> sends the data to web server in background
	
	Approach 1: XMLHttpRequest Object to make Ajax Call . XMLHttpRequest ()
	
	Approach 2: We will use jQuery to make an Ajax callbacks
	
	Aproach 3: fetch() API which is used to make flexible structure

	===============================================================================
	
	Libraries provide predefined functions and classes to make work easier
	
	Framework is a foundation upon which developers can build application

    Create React Application

    2 ways -> 1) using cdn
              2) using npx 	
			  
	Visual Studio Code
	Live Server
	Script Enable (VS Code ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets)
	
	<html>
		<head>
		</head>
		<body>
		    <h1>  Welcome <h1>
		</body>
		</html>
		
	
	JSX => Javascript XML 
	
	JSX allows us to write HTML in React
	
	<h1> Welcome to JSX </h1> ;
	
	props => <button type="button" disabled=true color="black"></button>
	
	https://react-md.dev/migration-guides/v4-to-v5
	
	 React  
	 React DOM 
	 ReactDOM.render()
	 Javascript -> Create Element
	 CDN Html => first way
	 JSX 
	 const a = <h1>Welcome </h1>;
	 
	 Component => Header (should start with capital letter)
	 
	 pass props(dept) to function Header => should not attempt to change the props 
                         Pure Functions 	
     
	 npx create-react-app sampleapp
     						 
	 Install Bootstrap 
	
	  Bootstrap => CDN 
	 
	  React Bootstrap => as a task 
	  
	  https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
	  
	   3 ways
  
      1. <> </>
      2. <Fragment> = Named Export 
      3. <React.Fragment>
	  
	  Default and Named Export 
	  
	  React
	  
	  export const Fragment={}
	  
	  export default React ;
	  
	  React Props
	  ======================================================
	  
	  props can be used to pass data from parent to child component
	  
	  attributes to components 
	  
	  1. Props can be destructuring for easy usage 
	  
	     destructuring of object in react-app
		 
		 const userData = {name:"Kumar",age:50}
		 
		 const {name,age} = userData;
		 
	   2. Props can have default values (default Parent will be taken ,if Parent is not specified child will be taken)
	   3. Props will take default value as true if no value is passed 
	   4. Passing objects as props, Spread Operator

       =====================================================================================

       Conditional Rendering
	   
	   Based on Some Condition we want to show our content or not

       1. Show or Hide Component
       2. Implementing the Role Based Permission Level(End User , Agents ,Admin)
       3. Toggling Functionalities 

       Task : age>18 <DrivingLicense/> 
	   
	  {props.age>18 && <EligibleForDrivingLicense/>}
	  
	  const value = true && "license"; // license 
	  
	  true && true => true 
	  true && false => false
	  false && true => false
	  false && false => false
