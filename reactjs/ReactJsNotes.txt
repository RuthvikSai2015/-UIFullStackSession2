    AJAX -> Asynchronous Javascript(callbacks) and XML
	
	AJAX is not a programming language its a programming concept 
	
	-> using callbacks,promises , async/await we can achieve asynchronous way of programming
	-> Application Programming Interface 
	
	-> Reads data from a web server after the page has been loaded
	-> Updates the page(part of element) without reloading the page
